# Know Your Nudibranchs (A Scuba Diver’s Guide to Sea Slugs) (Sketch 1)
### NMNHINV+nudibranchia | Invertebrate Zoology (NMNHINV) | 177 entries (too few?)
Nudibranchs are often tiny, toxic sea slugs that are brightly colored. They’re a favorite for scuba divers who like little things to look at. New ones are being discovered all the time. The Smithsonian’s invertebrate zoology collection has a number of specimens which include nudibranchia. The data available for nudibranchia includes location, taxonomic name, depth found - these are the aspects that would be explored in the data visualization. Four viewboxes would highlight these various aspects depending on what was selected–a geographical map for location, a dot plot for illustrating depth, taxonomic name, and the image itself with some of its details.

# Where Art Imitates Life (Sketch 2)
### SAAM+botanical+study | American Art Museum (SAAM) | 776 entries
### (Paired with matching entries by taxonomic name in NMNHBOTANY+herbarium)
Can art bring a specimen to life? Botanical studies are the most artistically attractive examples of what was originally utilitarian because a collector’s dried specimen no longer was fresh and vibrant and the colors would change. This illustrative process began before photography even existed. A good botanical illustration/painting is often more informative than a photograph. It would be interesting to juxtapose a herbarium specimen and a botanical study of the same species for people to contemplate the power of art to bring back to life the dried specimen.
Using a tree map of the American Art Museum’s botanical studies art as a base, specimens from the Botany collections herbarium would be matched/paired by taxonomic name (so long as there was a matching pair from both collections). Organized by taxonomy and by amount of available pieces with visuals, viewers can move within the system to learn about a variety of things (SAAM’s collection of botanical studies, how taxonomy works, comparisons between art and their real life examples, Botany’s collection of herbarium specimens).

### NMNHBOTANY+herbarium | Botany Department (NMNHBOTANY) | 11788 entries (too many?)
Herbarium - a collection of preserved plant specimens
Given all the hundreds of thousands of plants on earth, how do we make any sense of it? (How does taxonomy work?) The system was created by Carl Linnaeus, in the 1700s. He tried to bring order to the naming of species and invented the binomial system. All plants in a group have a genus name with each individual species having a species name. Genuses are grouped into families, families are grouped into orders, and orders are grouped into class, who are grouped into phylum/division, and finally you have the kingdom. Plants is the kingdom. In order to avoid confusion, within the kingdom of plants, every genus name has to be different.
Kingdom, Phylum/Division, Class, Order, Family, (Subfamily), Taxonomic name (binomial name with genus first in initial cap, followed by the species name)
This tree/web visualization categorizes the herbarium collections of the Botany department of the Smithsonian by taxonomy.
